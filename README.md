# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python using OOP.
It also features a score keeping functionality.

## Overview

* The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
* This implementation of the game allows you to play against a computer opponent that makes random moves.
* Players take turns to make a move, marking their symbol ('X' or 'O') on an empty cell.
* The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
* If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
